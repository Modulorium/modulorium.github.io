        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a software and game developer with experience across a wide range of projects, both in-game and using external tools. I specialize in creating gameplay systems and custom mechanics in games like Minecraft, where I've developed public server events, datapacks, and interactive NPCs. I've also worked with a variety of game engines (including Unity, Unreal, and Godot) to prototype and build game mechanics, primarily world gen.

        <p>   
            When I'm not working on a project, I enjoy playing a variety of games. Some of my favorites are Hollow Knight, Minecraft, Darkwood, and Super Mario Odyssey, with survival sandbox being my preferred genre.
